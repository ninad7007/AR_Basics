# AR_Basics
This is a full package for the basic working of AR using unity and Vuforia.
All you need to do is open the project in unity and build it
Check if the Vuforia licence key is present in the Build>Build settings>Vuforia Configurations.
If no licence key is present you can create one by creating an account on developer.vuforia.com
